Contemplary issues with cloud computing 



## Cyber Attacks
Cyber-attacks are the major threats and have been classified to be the highest ranked in terms of the issues with cloud computing. Perpetrator have realized that most companies are moving their infrastructure to cloud and now it gets a concern and a way to easily grant the hackers a common target. There have been many reported cases with FACEBOOK, WHATSAPP and INSTAGRAM being the recent ones to be reported ("Not Just You! WhatsApp, Instagram, & Facebook are down for many Users", 2021).
Lack of support
There is minimum support for the public versions and the community versions. In order to gain full support someone have to work with the premium services and private method. These is very costly for some companies as they have to hire experts to work on it and ensure that all services are deployed. 
## Data duplication
Data duplication is something that is less considered by most people. However an application is collects information from many people and saves on the cloud it is most likely to get many duplicated information in it. Currently there are algorithms that are being placed to reduce this issue like the MAPREDUCE in AWS and Azure. 
Cost
 The cost of getting a premium storage location which is private is always expensive compared to the community and public versions. The private distributed version of cloud computing are managed privately but the public servers are shared by many people hence increasing the risk. Hence most companies have to accrue large costs in the verge of employing the best versions of the servers for the cloud platforms like the Azure (Durcevic, 2021). 
## Building a cloud platform
In order to build a cloud platform is not an easy thing. Many components are required to be actively hosted and easily accessible. Building a cloud platform simply will ensure that all the languages are easily shared and allowed like different languages, different platforms can be implemented and other related instances like database languages. 
## Legal liability and compliance
Companies that engage in the cloud computing technology mainly ends up failing to follow the compliance provided by them from the insurance. These is because there are many licenses that are to be complied to like the compliance to ensure personal data protection and when breached the companies incurs losses. 
Infrastructure Management
When a company have a lot of things to monitor on the cloud, it becomes hard for them. Example a company might be relying on different servers to issue he services to its clients. If not well monitored might lead to losses. 
## Standardization
 There is a general standardization for the cloud computing services. These makes the method seem less effective and distributed servers have to be applied. The standardization is mainly seen from the AZURE platform and the developers who host the services using the Microsoft Azure.
